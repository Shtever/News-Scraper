# News Scraper
## Stephen McMillen
## **All the news that's fit to scrape**

***The following elements have been used in creating this homework:***

- Javascript/JQuery
- .gitignore
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express
- Express Handlebars
- Cheerio
- Axios
- Morgan
- And many more!


In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news.

But we didn't actually write any of the articles. These articles were populated on the page using Mongoose and Cheerio. The articles are from Al Jazeera.

This assignment also allows the user to leave comments/notes on the articles that are presented in the browser. The comments are saved in the MongoDB database, and can be viewed when the user clicks on the article title. They can also be viewed in Robo 3t. If the user no longer wants the notes on the article, there is also an option to clear the comment.
